This repository is to maintain the codes for Android Studio Latest Features.

The tutorials for each feature updated in each commit is on my youtube channel - TheIITianCoder.

Each commit has a new JAVA File , New Layout File and some changes to gradle and manifest and hence , you can just look at the tutorial,clone this repo as a whole or just
look at the changes in that commit to implement your own version of that feature.

Enjoy Coding !!
